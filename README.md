# information_retrieval
Project assignment for information retrieval class
The goal was to build an arbitrary information retrieval system on the Cranfield dataset to achieve the maximal mean average precision (MAP).
The solution was a nearly from scratch build of TFIDF based retrieval and optimized to achieve a high score. It did place among the top 12 highest scoring systems in the class.
However due to this being my very first programming assignment when I was a complete beginner, it is full of poorly written code, anti-patterns and no regard for performance optimization leading to very poor time and space complexity.
